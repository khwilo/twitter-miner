# Twitter Data Mining

Mining Twitter data using Python

## Getting Started
1. Register the application.  
- Log in to Twitter and head to the [application management page](http://apps.twitter.com/).  
- Locate the **Keys and Access Tokens** tab to authenticate the application.  
  - Consumer Key (API key) and Consumer Secret (API secret) are settings for the application.
  - Access Token and Access Token Secret are settings for the user account.
2. Choose Twitter API client


**NOTE**: *Review the Twitter API rate limit and choose a way to avoid being limited [here](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting).*  
* API to access Twitter can be categorized into two classes:
  * REST APIs (Published tweets)
  * Streaming APIs (upcoming tweets)
